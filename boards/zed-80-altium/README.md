The Altium version of the board was only completed up to the schematic level due to issues with footprints, layout, and routing.
KiCAD comes with known good footprints for all the used components unlik Altium, and I could not get the multi-route and ActiveRoute tools in Altium to work properly. Therefore, for simplicity, and to be able to finish the project, I chose to switch from Altium to KiCAD.
